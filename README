--- HarDClanZ Package Collection ---

* This repository contains all software adopted by HarDClanZ Linux 
* Every directory contains a Buildfile - script used to create .hard package
* HarDClanZ adopts only free software (published under terms or FSF or OSI approved licenses or public domain)

--- Creating Packages ---

* Buildfile - shell script used to create .hard package
* contains:
* predefined:
	$CONFIGUREOPTS - default options for ./configure
	$DEST	 - resulting directory
	$MAKEOPTS - make options defined in /etc/hpkg/make.conf
	$CFLAGS	 - C compile flags defined in /etc/hpkg/make.conf
	$CXXFLAGS - CXX compile flags defined in /etc/hpkg/make.conf
* user-defined:
	$PACKAGE - package name
	$VER	 - package version
	$ARCH	 - hard archive type (mostly installer)
	$ACCESS	 - hard archive access (mostly restricted)
	$CRYPT	 - hard archive encrypt (mostly key)
(@)	$DEPENDS - space-separated array of dependencies
(@)	$CONFLICTS - space-separated array of conflicts
	$SRCURL	 - URL to be fetched
	$SRCTGZ	 - file that will be fetched
	$SRCDIR	 - dir entered after $SRCTGZ unpacking
	__getsrc - function fetching $SRCURL
	__unpacksrc - function unpacking $SRCTGZ
	__preparesrc - function preparing $SRCDIR (./configure, applying patches, etc)
	__compilesrc - function compiling $SRCDIR (make, etc)
	__installsrc - function installing $SRCDIR in $DEST (make install, etc)

# Note: hmake automatically enters $SRCDIR before calling __preparesrc
#	hmake automatically safely strips static, shared libs and executables

* Use Buildfile-example as example 

* hmake - tool to create .hard packages using related Buildfile
	cd ./<desired-package>
	hmake build	# Create package
	hmake install	# Install package
	hmake distclean	# Clean directory
* buildrepo - tool to build entire repository
	# root of repository dir
	buildrepo
	# 1. Cast 'hmake distclean' for every package
	# 2. Cast 'hmake build' for every package
	# 3. Copy packages in 'repo' directory
	# 4. Write entries in repo/ROADMAP

* For additional information read documentation that can be found in hpkg/packing repo
